This model was created for the kaggle Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster competition(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). I have used Logistic Regression for predicting the results.
I used a Simple Imputer to fill in the missing values in the Dataset, most frequent or mode being used for non-numeric values and median for numeric. I also used Ordinal Encoder to transform the string values into numeric for using them in the predictor.
Standard Scaler was also used to scale the values.
The accuracy for this model is currently 0.64114. The score was calculated using RMSE. I plan to make further improvements to the model.
